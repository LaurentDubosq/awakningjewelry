# Image Export Guidelines

## Supported Formats

### AVIF

We use the **AVIF** format for most photos and images in the application, as it currently offers the best quality-to-file-size ratio for our needs.

#### Exporting from Photoshop

1. Go to **File** > **Save As**
2. Choose **AV1 Image** as the file type
3. Set the export parameters:
   - **Quality**:
     - Mobile: `45`
     - Desktop: `50`
   - **Compression speed**: `Slowest`

### PNG

The **PNG** format can be used for small images that require transparency (e.g. favicon, tiny photo portrait).  
Keep in mind that PNG files are usually heavier than AVIF and should be used sparingly.
